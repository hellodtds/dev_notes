We sometimes forget long-time rules of English grammar in our day to day world of buzz words and feigned attempts to execute clear communication.

## Affect and Effect

__Is affected or is effected?__

Affected and effected are two words that are commonly confused in writing, while their meanings are related they are very different. ... It's an action word of actually doing something, i.e. "He effected a reorganization of the finance department." Affected is used to describe something being impacted.

__What is the rule of affect and effect?__

So the basic rule of thumb is that “affect” is almost always a verb and “effect” is usually a noun. There are deviations from this, but when in doubt, stick to the rule. If you need help remembering, think of this mnemonic device: The action is affect, the end result is effect.
